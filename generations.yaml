    description: "The Fiat Grande Punto represented a significant leap forward from the previous Punto, designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro in collaboration with Fiat Centro Stile. Built on the GM Fiat Small platform (later used for the Opel Corsa D), it was substantially larger than its predecessor, approaching the next segment in size. The exterior featured distinctive styling with elongated headlights, a prominent grille, and a sporty stance that gave it a more premium appearance compared to earlier Fiat small cars. Engine options included various petrol units ranging from a 1.2L 8v to a 1.4L 16v, plus the innovative 1.3L MultiJet diesel. The Abarth Grande Punto introduced in 2007 offered enhanced performance with a 1.4L T-Jet turbocharged engine producing 155 HP. The interior represented a significant improvement in quality and design over previous Fiat models, with better materials and a more modern layout. The Grande Punto achieved commercial success across Europe, helping to revitalize Fiat's reputation in the supermini segment with its combination of style, space, and value."

  - name: "First Generation (Project 199) 2009 Facelift (Punto Evo)"
    start_year: 2009
    end_year: 2012
    description: "The Punto Evo was a substantial facelift of the Grande Punto, featuring completely redesigned front and rear styling to align with Fiat's then-current design language. Presented in September 2009 at the Frankfurt Motor Show, the exterior changes included a more pronounced front fascia, new headlights and taillights, and revised bumpers. Engine options were updated to include the new MultiAir technology in petrol engines, offering improved efficiency and performance. The interior received a complete redesign with a new dashboard, improved materials, and the introduction of Fiat's Blue&Me connectivity system. Safety features were enhanced, allowing the model to achieve a 5-star Euro NCAP rating. This update maintained the Grande Punto's core attributes while modernizing its appearance and technology."

  - name: "First Generation (Project 199) 2012 Facelift (Punto)"
    start_year: 2012
    end_year: 2018
    description: "Fiat introduced the 2012 Punto in September 2011 at the Frankfurt Motor Show as a facelifted version of the Punto Evo that reintroduced the Punto nomenclature (without 'Grande' or 'Evo'). This final iteration of the platform saw a return to simpler styling, with relatively minor exterior changes focusing on bumper designs, light clusters, and trim elements. The base 'Pop' trim level reverted to the older Grande Punto interior, while higher trims maintained the revised rear lights and interior of the 2009 Punto Evo. The engine lineup was rationalized to focus on more efficient options, including the 0.9L TwinAir and updated MultiJet diesels. In June 2016, Fiat introduced the new 'Techno Pack' with a 5-inch touchscreen infotainment system and cruise control. Production ended on 7 August 2018 in Europe, with the car remaining in production in India for an additional three months before ending in November 2018."
